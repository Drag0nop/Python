# it's a leetcode question no. 2561 where You have two fruit baskets containing n fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays basket1 and basket2 representing the cost of fruit in each basket.
# You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

# Chose two indices i and j, and swap the ith fruit of basket1 with the jth fruit of basket2.
# The cost of the swap is min(basket1[i],basket2[j]).
# Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

# Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or -1 if impossible.
